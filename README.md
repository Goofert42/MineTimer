# MineTimer
Minecraft doesn't have a native way of recording overall playtime, like Steam or PlayStation. MineTimer fixes this issue! 

With MineTimer you can easily record your overall playtime with only a couple of clicks.

# How to Use
All you need to do is download the installer and run it. From there MineTimer will open every time you boot up your computer and will run in the background.

To view your playtime, navigate to the tray and right click the MineTimer logo and click view playtime.
